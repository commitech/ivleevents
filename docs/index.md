# IVLE Event Approval Guide

## Is the event description present?
1. If no, reject with category “Incomplete/missing event description” and reason “Please fill in the event description”

## Is the event description presented also in English?
1. If not, then reject with category “Incomplete event details” and reason “Please provide English translation for the event”
2. If they use images, it’s ok for the image not to be in English, but they need to give English transcription as well.

## Are there any broken link (for image, especially)?
1. If yes, reject with category “Others” and reason “Please upload the images to some reliable image hosting site such as Tinypic and try submitting again”

## Is the organizer a registered club, OSA, Staff Club, or graduate researchers?
Check the list at http://www.nus.edu.sg/osa/activities/svcs/societies.html (But not updated, need to contact OSA)

1. If not, most likely reject with category “Unregistered committee” and reason “Only registered NUS clubs or approved parties may post events in IVLE Students Events”

## Is the event a study (research, experiment)?
1. Make sure that there is a professor/supervisor name inside. Contact for the supervisor is not necessary, we just need at least the name.

## Is the display duration less than 14 days?
1. If not, adjust the duration to be at most 14 days
2. The adjusted starting date of new date should not be earlier than requested starting date, and the adjusted end date should not be later than requested end date
3. Remember as well to have the end date no later than one day of the end of the event

## Is the event appropriate for NUS students?

## Is the event already posted (either in Events Requests or Events List) ?
1. If yes, check whether there is any e-mail regarding that particular event. At any case, use your understanding and choose and approve the best event description according to you and reject the others with category “Duplicate Post”. Remember to keep the display dates to the rules.
2. The event title might be different although it's the same event, because the event might be posted by two different persons. Just keep your eyes on this case.

## Reasons of rejection
1. Exceeded view period limit (14 days)
2. Incomplete/missing event description (including Broken Link, contact number without person’s name)
3. Unrelated external events
4. Inappropriate content
5. Duplicate post
6. Unregistered committee
One example of unregistered committee: Start Up recruitment
